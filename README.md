# Math-Magicians

"Math-Magician" is a web app for all lovers of mathematics. It is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to make simple calculations, generate and read random math-related quotes and also tweet the quote.

Our goal here is to Build a single page web application for mathematics weebs using the React library 


### Features implemented so far are:

- Project Setup with React Installations
## Built With

- React 
- Linters
## Live Demo


### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- Have a good knowledge on how to parse UI designs
- Have VSCode or other text editor installed. [Link to download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install node package. [Link to download node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Have git installed.[Link to download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Create a github repository.
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
#### Cloning the project

```
git clone  https://github.com/Lizdev-05/math-magician <Your-Build-Directory>

```

```
cd <Your-Build-Directory> 

```

## Getting packages and dependencies
To get all package modules required to build the project run:
```
npm install
```
every package module required to build the project is listed in the package.json file. this is used as a reference to get all dependencies.

## Building 

To build the project run:
```
npm run build
```
after you run this sucessfully you'd locate the build from in the ```build``` folder located from the parent directory of the project.

## Running

To run the program on a browser through a server run this command in your cli
```
npm start
```
This should open the page in your localhost on port 3000. then you'd be able to view the built page generated using webpack.

## Run tests

For tracking linters errors locally, you need to follow these steps:

- For tracking linter errors in CSS file run:
``` 
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```
- For tracking linter errors in Javascript file run:
```
npx eslint .
```
